# MongoDB Data Access With ExpressJS Lab I

## Overview
In this lab, you will learn to setup an ExpressJs server and connect to a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

1. Download and install NodeJS and NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs
2. Download and install MongoDB Community version: https://www.mongodb.com/products/self-managed/community-edition
3. Download and install MongoDB Compass: https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass
4. Download and install Git from this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads

## Build Instructions
1. Fork this Git repository locally
2. Go to the folder where you installed the repository and run 'npm install'
3. Make sure your local MongoDB service is running. To do so go to the windows Services app and check the service's status.
4. If the MongoDB service is not running, start the service. You can do so by running Terminal as an admin and on the prompt type 'net start MongoDB'

## Tasks / Instuctions

Run the code by typing 'npm run start'. 
If all the dependencies where correctly installed, you should see the following message: 'Server started on port:3000'

## Testing and Validation requisites

There is one Mocha test that checks if the server ran correctly. To perform the test, type "npm run test" on the command prompt.
The test should pass and coverage should be 100%

## Acceptance Criteria
Please provide a screenshot of the test passing
